# Road Sign Detection and Accident-Prone Zone Alerting System

This project is aimed at enhancing road safety through a real-time system that detects traffic signs and alerts drivers when entering accident-prone areas. It integrates computer vision, GPS, and machine learning to assist drivers with timely alerts and improve overall road awareness.

---

## 🚦 Problem Statement

Due to increasing accidents caused by driver negligence and lack of road sign awareness, this system is developed to:

- Automatically detect and recognize road signs from live video.
- Identify accident-prone zones using GPS and a preloaded database.
- Alert the driver via visual and audio notifications.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Real-time traffic sign detection using deep learning (CNN).
- GPS-based accident zone tracking.
- Driver alert system with non-intrusive warnings.
- Optional user interface to display current alerts and signs.

---

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **OpenCV** (for image processing)
- **TensorFlow / Keras** (for CNN model)
- **GPS Module**
- **Audio Output / Buzzer** (for alerts)
- **Arduino / Raspberry Pi** (optional hardware integration)
